                Lets say for example you were building a sky scraper,
                which would you hire to design it, a construction worker an architect?
                I'm assuming you answered architect. The same goes for building web applications,
                if your building anything bigger then a home page for your soccer team then your
                going to need to somebody that knows how to building scalable, reliable applications.

                <h5>Building the tools</h5>
                Now were not saying that construction workers don't play an important part of the
                development process. They do, there is no denying that.
                With our assistance we will give them the game plan and the tools to get the job done.

                Building a fully functional web application can be just as monstrous of an undergoing
                as building a sky scrapper. We can help guide you through each phase.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Top of the line architecture:</b>

            Each and every application is engineered from the ground up ensuring that the data structure 
            is in 3rd normal form. We use frameworks and libraries that are all object oriented and utilize
            the Model View Control to separate out the different components of the application.
        <p>
        <p id="toolsInternal">
            <b>Tools â€“ internally Components and Frameworks:</b>

            A large part of what makes us different from most of the other web application developers
            you will find is that we are firm believers in giving your designers and developers
            to build off of what we have done. This means we build a core framework for your application
            and then your in house designers and developers can create, maintain, and update the components
            that add extra functionality to the application.
        <p>

        <p>
            <b>Tools - externally Platforms, and APIs:</b>

            The day of stand alone websites is over.
            Yes old fashion websites would share information via links but the new juggernauts
            of our time have demonstrated that is not enough.
            Companies like Google are building frameworks,
            and APIs that allow other websites to vastly expand their capabilities
            far beyond what they would be able to achieve on their own.
            Each of the top 10 websites in the USA have a platform for distributing data.
            9 out of 10 have an API(Craigslist.com is the only exception,
            it uses RSS feeds to distribute data). See for your self:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://code.google.com">Google</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/dev">Youtube</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://dev.live.com/">Live</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API">Wikipedia</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.blogger.com/developers/api/1_docs/">Blogger</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://developer.ebay.com/">E-Bay</a></li>
            </ul>
            This separates a good site from a great site. By allowing other developers to build
            applications off of their site the extend their viewer base exponentially.
