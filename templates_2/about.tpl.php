        <p>
            A wise man once said 'A rising tide raises all ships'. Creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, believed it. Google believes it, and I, Matt Lea, believe it. There is this archaic notion in the business world that its all 'kill or be killed'. All to often I see individuals and businesses that suffer from that school of thought on the 'Be Killed' side of things.
            As individuals our abilities are limited, but if we work together, sharing knowledge and resources there is nothing we cannot accomplish. The internet is just one medium for collaborating and sharing resources. If we build the tools to allow people to share, collaborate and create then this will push people far beyond what they would be capable of on their own. In return the people using these tools will give us the ability to succeed far beyond what we would be capable of with out them.

            <h3>Start Ups</h3>

            I believe each man is in charge of his own destiny, and that there are few things more noble in this life then when a person takes charge of their own destiny and starts creating something new.
            While the dinosaurs are fighting over limited existing markets these cowboys are out there exploring the vast uncharted markets. This is why you will see my team and I always rooting for the under dog and supporting start ups.

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            I am assuming you didn't come to this page just to read my ramblings about philosophy,  So here is a little background on me: I was born and raised in Wisconsin, but have traveled around the majority of the United States working on different projects. I have built sites for top modeling agencies in NYC and built content management systems and voting applications for the Academy of Country Music that were used through out the 2009 show in Las Vegas seen on NBC. After working the 9AM to 5PM(and a couple 9AM to 9AM the next day) I decided to it was time to take a leap and start building something of my own. Since then I have never looked back.

            <h3>The future</h3>
            That is up to you. I know what I am going to do, I'm going to keep on taking risks, learning, teaching, loving, leading and living. I suggest you do the same, take the long shot now while you still have breath in your lungs and a skip in your step. Life is to short to look back and think “If I only...”.
