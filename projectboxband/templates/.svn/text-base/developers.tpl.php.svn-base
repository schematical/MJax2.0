    <h3>Customize Project Box Band</h3>
    <p>
        Project Box Band was developed from the ground up as a platform to allow developers to rapidly skin the appearance of and build extended functionality off of the core. There are three simple ways in which you as a developer can do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Skins:</h4>
        Skins are templates that a Project Box Band user can download and use to display their content.

        <h4>Adapter Libraries:</h4>
        Adapter libraries connect Project Box Band to different services like gig listing services and music sale services. For example say you have mp3s of your performances on sale at itunes.com. You would use the itunes adapter library to connect to itunes and pull a list of your songs to your music page.

    <h3>How Project Box Band can help you</h3>
    <p>
        If your a designer or a developer your probably asking your self how Project Box Band can benefit you?
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Create Skins</h4>
        You can create skins and sell them stock or for the artists looking for a personal touch you can sell your services custom skins. As I am writing this we do not have a developer directory live, but it will be coming soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Create Addons</h4>
        Addons like skins can be created and sold as stock, but some Project Box Band users may opt to hire a developer create a custom addon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Write an Adapter Library</h4>
        If you run a web site that provides a preforming artist a specific service you can create a adapter library that extends that service to a Project Box Band user. See our <a href="/projectboxband/business.php">Partner with Us</a> page for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Contests</h4>
        We here at Project Box Band are working to partner with sponsors in an effort to set up contests where developers can submit skins and addons they have developed. More on this coming soon.
